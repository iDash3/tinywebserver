#### ordered by recency 

- backpacked China. picked up hints from the language (no noun declension, no tense/subject conjugation!!). [started collaborating with a linguistics proff]

- running Zepheon, a consulting agency that I started in SF. Began with ML but now do absolutely everything (can't fully disclose but: Generative AI Studio for an Architecture Firm, Distributed Analytics Mesh Platform for a lab in LA, Neural Knowledge Synthesis Engine for a legaltech startup)
  
- teaching transformers to a kid! [idea](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1793435710399160465) [[in progress](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1794730213798268970)]
  
- mexico's biggest hackathon [idea](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1789916104178946466) [[in progress](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1791195744432796007)]

- hosting a textfile on a c webserver [idea](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1793762282339729601) [[done](https://txt.isaacbs.com/)]

- infini: playground for my diffusion research [done - published soon]

- kioete: tequila high fashion! watched wasteful tequila production, decided to use the residues for something useful: got a partnership, learned textile chemistry, assembled a team, [ran lab tests](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1729293604957429955).  [[paused](https://www.instagram.com/kioete/)] 

- suun: solo traveler app. wanted to run graph ml algorithms on the real world while living in Germany, created an full app with multiple functionalities such as live chat, events, socials, map, etc. [[stopped](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sunn.app)]

- whycombinator: i made this app in a day to check competitors instead of searching for competitors [[done](https://whycombinator.app)]

- physics degree: got it
  - [some notes on electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, optics](https://github.com/iDash3/textbook_notes/tree/main)

- interned at Porsche in Germany. fluent (B2) german

- certified fluent in 4 (soon 5) languages. Just became obessesed with being able to communicate in my favorite countries [Japanese test in 4 months]

- 3d antennas: grandparents live in a mountain, had problems getting signal. designed and built antennas for them

- quantum tunneling loss and other ml trinkets [published soon]

- convolution and other ml basics:
  - [some notes on ml](https://github.com/iDash3/textbook_notes/tree/main)
