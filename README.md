#### ordered by recency

- lived in rural Japan for some time. fell in love with Japanese culture, decided to speed run the language

- got into the Mexican legal system bc of a tragic event, saw how terribly inneficient it was and created a solution. it's simple but it solves a huge problem. [currently being used by 3 law firms in Mexico]

- backpacked China. picked up hints from the language (no noun declension, no tense/subject conjugation!!). [small collaboration with a linguistics prof]

- running Zepheon, a consulting agency started in sf. began with ML but now do everything (portafolio: Generative AI Studio for a Chinese Architecture Firm, Analytics Platform for a lab in LA, AI Engine for a legaltech startup)

- mexico's biggest hackathon [idea](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1789916104178946466) [[in progress](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1791195744432796007)]
  
- teaching transformers to a kid! [idea](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1793435710399160465) [[in progress](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1794730213798268970)]

- infini: playground for my ML diffusion research [done - published soon]

- kioete: tequila high fashion! watched wasteful tequila production, decided to use the residues for something useful: got a partnership, learned textile chemistry, assembled a team, [ran lab tests](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1729293604957429955).  [[paused](https://www.instagram.com/kioete/)]

- hosting a textfile on a c webserver [idea](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1793762282339729601) [[done](https://txt.isaacbs.com/)]

- suun: solo traveler app. wanted to run graph ml algorithms on the real world while living in Germany, created a delightful app with live chat, events, socials, map, etc. Dozens of users (limited to my uni) [[stopped](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sunn.app)]

- whycombinator: made this app in a day to search for competitors instead of searching for competitors. it's pretty [[done](https://whycombinator.app)]

- physics degree: got it
  - [some notes on electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, optics](https://github.com/iDash3/textbook_notes/tree/main)

- interned at Porsche in Germany. fluent (B2) german

- studied physics at Dresden for a semester.

- certified fluent in 4 (soon 5) languages! became obessesed with being able to communicate in my favorite countries [Japanese test soon]

- 3d antennas: grandparents live in a mountain, had problems getting signal. designed and 3D printed antennas for them

- quantum tunneling loss and other ml trinkets [published soon]

- convolution and other ml basics:
  - [some notes on ml](https://github.com/iDash3/textbook_notes/tree/main)
  - cnn - [trivial kernel convolution in c](https://github.com/iDash3/Simple-Convolution-Kernel-Example)
  - cnn - [LoF(ai) girl](https://github.com/iDash3/LoFi-Girl-AI)
  - sam
  - diffusion models
  - transformers
  - ...

- ml paper remakes: explain theory using infini, then code them up from scratch.
  - sam
  - ...
 
- designed, built and raced robots at 16. only non university competitor at TryTa (robotics competition) [stopped bc it was too expensive]
 
- worked at VPS startup at 15
  
still updating
