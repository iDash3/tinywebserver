##### side quests
- pilot's licence (1%)

#### ordered by recency

- playable world models that run in your browser, all open source [[in progress]()]

- helping my parents build a shed on the weekends: designing wooden structures, installing roofs, having things both fall and surprisingly stay in place. it's weirdly satisfying to build a physical thing where you can take shelter

- started learning music ~2y ago and bought a cheap portable piano that i bring everywhere. everytime i hear a cool sound i recreate it. made an app with all the sounds i've been documenting. [[in progress]()]

- designed and manufactured my own backpack [[done]()]

- Built a one-command teacher-student pipeline that distilled Metaâ€™s 2.4B-param SAM ViT to a 5M TinyViT, trainable on a single RTX 4090; made an open source ONNX runtime local server for fast, GPU-free in-browser segmentation that handles all pre processing and inference of the mini model; developed production ready, open-source npm packages (minisam, minisam-react) with typed hooks, plug-and-play UI, and live demos. [[done](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1929628775207039123)]

- explained the entire math behind diffusion from absolute scratch!!! [[done](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1924902448470122563)]

- annoyed at Azure's expensive Postgres service. ran my own devops for it instead and made a tutorial so anyone can do it too [[done](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COW1veHWiaE&t=207s)]

- moved to montreal for a bit to practice my french. turns out they don't like speaking to you in french.

- got into the Mexican legal system bc of a tragic event, saw how terribly inneficient it was and created a solution. it's simple but it solves a huge problem. [currently being used by 3 law firms in Mexico, testing]

- lived in rural Japan for some time. fell in love with Japanese culture, decided to speed run the language

- lived in South Korea for some time. was very excited at first but left a bit disenchanted, the culture seems too far off from my own values. lovely place tho

- backpacked China. picked up hints from the language (no noun declension, no tense/subject conjugation!!). [possible colab w linguistics prof]

- got asked to help a team win a hackathon, which made me realize I could make money solving people's problems: ran Zepheon, a consulting agency started in sf. began with ML but did absolutely everything (portafolio: Generative AI Studio for an Architecture Firm, Analytics Platform for a lab in LA, AI Engine for a legaltech startup, more) [[stopped bc it got boring](https://zepheon.com)]

- mexico's biggest hackathon [idea](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1789916104178946466) [[in progress](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1791195744432796007)]
  
- teaching transformers to a kid! [idea](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1793435710399160465) [[paused](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1794730213798268970)]

- infini: a diffusion first infinite canvas app. I made this from scratch without ai and learned a ton about frontend optimization [[done](https://infini.computer)]

- hosting a textfile on a c webserver [idea](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1793762282339729601) [[done](https://txt.isaacbs.com/)]

- suun: solo traveler app. wanted to run graph ml algorithms on the real world while living in Germany, created a delightful app with live chat, events, socials, map, etc. Dozens of users (limited to my uni) [[stopped](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sunn.app)]

- kioete: tequila high fashion! watched wasteful tequila production, decided to use the residues for something useful: got a partnership, learned textile chemistry, assembled a team, [ran lab tests](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1729293604957429955).  [[paused](https://www.instagram.com/kioete/)]

- whycombinator: made this app in a day to search for competitors instead of searching for competitors. [[done](https://whycombinator.app)]

- physics degree: got it
  - [some notes on electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, optics](https://github.com/iDash3/textbook_notes/tree/main)

- interned at Porsche in Germany. fluent (B2) german

- studied physics and high performance computing at TU Dresden for a semester

- certified fluent in 4 (soon 5) languages! became obessesed with being able to communicate in my favorite countries [Japanese test soon]

- 3d antennas: grandparents live in a mountain, had problems getting signal. designed and 3D printed antennas for them

- quantum tunneling loss and other ml trinkets [published soon]

- convolution and other ml basics:
  - [some notes on ml](https://github.com/iDash3/textbook_notes/tree/main)
  - cnn - [trivial kernel convolution in c](https://github.com/iDash3/Simple-Convolution-Kernel-Example)
  - cnn - [LoF(ai) girl](https://github.com/iDash3/LoFi-Girl-AI)
  - sam
  - diffusion models
  - transformers
  - ...

- ml paper remakes: explain theory using infini, then code them up from scratch.
  - sam
  - ...
  
- worked at VPS startup at 16

- designed, built and raced robots by myself at 15. only high school competitor at TryTa (robotics competition) [stopped bc it was too expensive]

still updating
