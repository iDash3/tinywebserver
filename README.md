#### ordered by recency 

- backpacked China. picked up hints from the language (no noun declension, no tense/subject conjugation!!). [started collaborating with a linguistics prof]

- running Zepheon, a consulting agency that I started in SF. Began with ML but now do absolutely everything (can't fully disclose but: Generative AI Studio for an Architecture Firm, Distributed Analytics Mesh Platform for a lab in LA, Neural Knowledge Synthesis Engine for a legaltech startup)

- mexico's biggest hackathon [idea](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1789916104178946466) [[in progress](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1791195744432796007)]
  
- teaching transformers to a kid! [idea](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1793435710399160465) [[in progress](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1794730213798268970)]

- infini: playground for my ML diffusion research [done - published soon]
  
- hosting a textfile on a c webserver [idea](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1793762282339729601) [[done](https://txt.isaacbs.com/)]

- kioete: tequila high fashion! watched wasteful tequila production, decided to use the residues for something useful: got a partnership, learned textile chemistry, assembled a team, [ran lab tests](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1729293604957429955).  [[paused](https://www.instagram.com/kioete/)] 

- suun: solo traveler app. wanted to run graph ml algorithms on the real world while living in Germany, created a delightful app with live chat, events, socials, map, etc. Dozens of users (limited to my uni) [[stopped](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sunn.app)]

- whycombinator: made this app in a day to search for competitors instead of searching for competitors. it's pretty [[done](https://whycombinator.app)]

- physics degree: got it
  - [some notes on electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, optics](https://github.com/iDash3/textbook_notes/tree/main)

- interned at Porsche in Germany. fluent (B2) german

- certified fluent in 4 (soon 5) languages. simply became obessesed with being able to communicate in my favorite countries [Japanese test in 4 months]

- 3d antennas: grandparents live in a mountain, had problems getting signal. designed and 3D printed antennas for them

- quantum tunneling loss and other ml trinkets [published soon]

- convolution and other ml basics:
  - [some notes on ml](https://github.com/iDash3/textbook_notes/tree/main)
  - cnn - [trivial kernel convolution in c](https://github.com/iDash3/Simple-Convolution-Kernel-Example)
  - cnn - [LoF(ai) girl](https://github.com/iDash3/LoFi-Girl-AI)
  - sam
  - diffusion models
  - transformers
  - ...

- ml paper remakes: explain theory using infini, then code them up from scratch.
  - sam

- designed, built and raced robots at 16 [stopped bc it was too expensive]
 
- worked at VPS startup at 15
  
still updating
