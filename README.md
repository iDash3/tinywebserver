## did it

#### recent

- hosting a textfile on a c webserver [idea](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1793762282339729601) [[done](https://txt.isaacbs.com/)]
  
- teaching transformers to a kid [idea](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1793435710399160465) [[in progress](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1794730213798268970)]
  
- mexico's biggest hackathon [idea](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1789916104178946466) [[in progress](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1791195744432796007)]

#### not that recent

- infini: own (dingboard like) edtech software, infinite canvas with ai. motivation was a google colab for theretical papers all the way to first principles. currently being used to teach a kid transformers and to explain the theoretical side of papers. [done - published soon]

- quantum tunneling loss and other ml trinkets [published soon]

- suun: solo traveler app. wanted to run graph ml algorithms on the real world while living in Germany, created an entire app with multiple functionalities such as live chat, events, socials, maps, etc. [[stopped](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sunn.app)]

- whycombinator: explore startup latent space (automatic webscraper, vector search, frontend) [[done](https://whycombinator.app)]

- kioete: tequila clothes. watched wasteful tequila production, decided to use the residues for something useful: high fashion. got a partnership, learned chemistry, assembled a team, [ran lab tests](https://x.com/isaacbautistas/status/1729293604957429955).  [[paused](https://www.instagram.com/kioete_/)] 

- convolution and other ml basics:
  - [some notes on ml](https://github.com/iDash3/textbook_notes/tree/main)
  - cnn - [trivial kernel convolution in c](https://github.com/iDash3/Simple-Convolution-Kernel-Example)
  - cnn - [LoF(ai) girl](https://github.com/iDash3/LoFi-Girl-AI)
  - sam
  - diffusion models
  - transformers from scratch
  - kan

- ml paper remakes: explain theory using infini, then code them up from scratch.
  - sam
  - ...

- 3d antennas: grandparents live in a mountain, had problems getting signal. designed and built antennas for them. connected the mountains.  

- physics degree: got it
  - [some notes on electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, optics](https://github.com/iDash3/textbook_notes/tree/main)
