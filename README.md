I lost the code for my original website [isaacbs.com](https://isaacbs.com). This is a text file running on a minimalist [C web server](https://github.com/iDash3/tinywebserver.git). A literal README

## QUESTS

main quest:
- ************ (soon)
- get my visa to stay in SF forever

Side quests:
- run Mexico's biggest Hackaton, cash prize, no talks, no speakers. (get all the cracked people in Mexico and show them that they're great, there's opportunities everywhere) 
- design and manufacture my own clothing (close)

life side quests:
- pilot's licence (0%)
- speak 5 languages (4/5)
- play piano (~30% there)

## Build history

#### I'll update / prune it later

##### 3D Antennas [week build]

My grandparents had problems connecting to the wifi in the remote part of Mexico where they live. I decided to design and 3D print Yagi antennas to help them out!

##### suun [months build]

Developed a social media app to connect international students online. Ran Graph ML algorithms. Reached some hundred users before deciding to work on something else. The app has a bunch of really cool features!

##### Kioete [months build]

After watching the wasteful process of tequila production, decided to do something about it. Used agave (plant from which tequila is distilled) residuals to form textiles to create a high fashion, truly eco brand. Learned everything from scratch, formed a partnership with a producer in Mexico, ran lab tests.

##### infini [month build]

Built an educational platform with AI to approach any topic from first principles! Currently using the tool to teach a bright high schooler advanced Machine Learning and to explain the theoretical side of ML papers.

##### whyCombinator [day build]

Made an automatic web scraper with the new AI video inputs, then scraped VCs and made a very pretty semantic search service. Explore the startup latent space.

##### C Kernel Convolution & Other ML Projects [day builds]

Created a bunch of code examples for all types of ML topics:
- CNN - Kernel Convolution Example
- Music - LoF(ai) Girl
- SAM
- Diffusion Models
- Transformers from Scratch
- KAN ?

##### C web server [day build]
This page is hosted on my own web server made using C.

##### ML Paper remake [day builds]

I explain (using infini) the theoretical part of papers and then code them up from scratch.
- SAM (Segment Anything) - Paper theoretical explanation and code re make

##### Quantum Tunneling Loss and Other Trinkets [weeks build]

I have fun exploring the possibility of a loss function that could traverse the a potential barrier similar to a quantum particle.

##### Arrakis [month build]

Running Mexico's biggest hackathon.

## Books

I love reading (i usually do 20-30 books/year), I'll setup a new page for that but so far some of my favorites are:

- Siddartha by Herman Hesse (beautiful)
- Stories of Your Life and Others by Ted Chiang (so damn good)
- Cronica de una muerte anunciada by Gabriel Garcia Marquez (super funny)
- Foundation (1) by Isaac Asimov (good)
- Dune (1) by Frank Herbert (fun)
- Napoleon by Ludwig Emil (he does yap a lot tho) 
- Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond (also yaps a lot but def worth it)
